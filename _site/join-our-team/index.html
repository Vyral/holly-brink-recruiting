<p>Dear Real Estate Agent, </p>

<p>I understand that as a newly licensed agent, you had a big vision for your future in this business, but you have yet to see the fruits of your labor. When you compare the past to the present, your current situation seems like a far cry from your once-lofty ambitions, and the pains definitely outweigh the gains. </p>

<p>Maybe you work for a brokerage in a cramped office where you feel trapped in a cycle of paying brick-and-mortar expenses that only hinder your personal and professional progress. You long for the day when you can expand and become more independent, but you know doing that costs money—money you unfortunately don’t have. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, you’re tired of having to chase down unresponsive brokers or deal with competing brokers. Worst of all, your brokerage or team falls short when it comes to supporting and equipping their agents with sufficient systems and training that not only makes career advancement possible, but certain.  </p>

<p>The sad truth is that you’re far from the only one struggling to get ahead in this industry. As a matter of fact, <strong>a staggering 87% of new agents fail to ever gain a footing in the early stages of their career and end up exiting the industry within just one year.</strong> It’s not surprising given the fact that most agents who fail lack what you lack—proper support and the money to pay exorbitant overhead costs. </p>

<p>As a self-starter, you’ve probably explored solutions to turn your ailing career around and start on a path toward success. It could be that you’ve pursued professional advice through internet-based avenues like Facebook or YouTube or you’re paying for a high-priced career coach. After a while, you realize you’re going from one shiny object to the next hoping that something will cure your lack of success, yet the problem remains unsolved. </p>

<p>And you can’t even get a good night’s sleep. You lie awake at night burdened by the fact that you’re spending more money than you’re earning, and you wonder where your next deal will come from. The longer things continue this way, the further into debt you slide. Something’s got to give or else you’ll eventually become part of that 87% of agents who go out of business having gained little more than a mountain of debt. </p>

<p>There is a light at the end of the tunnel, though, and it doesn’t involve leaving your career in real estate behind you. It involves partnering with me and transforming your life and business for the better. </p>

<p>Allow me to introduce myself. <strong>My name is Holly Brink</strong>, and I’ve experienced the growing pains of journeying toward success. Before becoming <strong>eXp’s designated managing broker here in Iowa</strong>, I began my career climbing the ladder in property management out in Arizona. One thing led to another and I eventually earned my real estate license. I moved to Iowa and soon discovered that as a buyer’s agent, I didn’t thrive in a team setting as much as I had back in Arizona. But that all changed when I joined eXp Realty. Though I’m not formally on a team, our cloud-based structure has all the elements of a team environment: We brainstorm, we can connect with agents nation- and worldwide, and we have a truly limitless supply of ideas and resources at our fingertips. </p>

<p>More to the point, <strong>the solution you’ve been seeking is eXp Realty.</strong> When you join, you’ll be plugged into a one-of-a-kind cloud-based brokerage where:
<ul class="indent">
<li>You won’t pay overhead fees </li>
<li>You’ll have full access to consistent systems and processes </li>
<li>You’ll collaborate and brainstorm with other results-driven agents </li>
<li>You’ll be able to supplement your income through revenue sharing, our mentor program, etc.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Unlike traditional brokerage models, you’ll have the opportunity to engage in income-producing activities beyond just buying and selling homes. <strong>Not to mention that the monthly fee you pay will provide you with:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Two agent websites </li>
<li>Our kvCORE CRM </li>
<li>A mentor if you’re still new to the business</li>
<li>Revenue-sharing opportunities </li>
<li>Business supplies at no cost </li>
<li>80% of the commission you earn </li>
<li>Stock awards and our stock discount program </li>
<li>The freedom to work from anywhere, including home</li>
<li>The freedom to recruit and build a team anywhere in the world </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Speaking of freedom, you’ll truly understand what it’s like to harness the power of leading-edge technology. Thanks to our interactive virtual environment eXp World and our 24/7 library, you won’t have to worry about a lack of training ever again: There, you’ll find 40 hours’ worth of educational training each week. In addition, you’ll be part of an online network of different workplace groups all collaborating in different ways. Whatever the focus of your business, you can be sure there’s a group that shares your focus and would be happy to have you join and collaborate. After all, collaboration is one of eXp’s core values!  </p>

<p>Ultimately, this decision is in your hands. You could continue down the path of inaction or you can bounce around from one big-box brokerage to another, all the while being part of a traditional team structure and drowning in desk, royalty, or franchise fees. But I’ll warn you: Doing what you’ve done from the start won’t pull you out of career stagnation. It’ll only set you back further. </p>

<p>Here’s my offer to you: <strong>Team up with me and eXp Realty and with each transaction you complete, you’ll earn 80% commission until you hit your $16,000 cap.</strong> Also per deal, you’ll pay a small fee of $40 for E&amp;O coverage (with an annual max of $500) and a $25 broker review fee. That’s the extent of your per-transaction costs!  </p>

<p>Moreover, you can elect to purchase stock with 5% of your commission at a 20% discount. Once you’ve reached your $16,000 cap, not only are you awarded stock, but a reduction in your per-transaction fee will kick in—$250 will be your new fee. At that point, you’ll be eligible to become an ‘icon agent’ and receive up to $16,000 back in company stock.</p>

<p>When you decide this opportunity is too good to pass up and fill out an application with us, the onboarding process will start right away. We’ll put you in touch with our eXp Connect program, where professional staff will give you a step-by-step walk-through on how to sign up with your workplace account, get situated with our virtual world, and get your business going. From there, you’ll be assigned a mentor who will work closely with you from square one, so you’re up to speed with our long list of resources we offer you and our clients. </p>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for an opportunity like this to come along, why wait any longer? The longer you sit and hope for change to happen on its own, the longer you deny your true potential for achieving success. Now’s the time to realize those professional goals you set when you launched your real estate career. Now’s the time to give me a call. </p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you very soon! </p>
