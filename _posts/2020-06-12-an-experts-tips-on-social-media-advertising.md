In today’s show, I’m interviewing eXp Realty Iowa agent Brent Sexton, who’s what I would call an expert on Facebook, Instagram, and social media advertising. He’s here to answer agents’ questions about Facebook advertising, internet leads, and much more. As our world only becomes &nbsp;more entrenched in social media and technology, it just makes sense that we as agents should hop on board. By following Brent’s tips, you can learn how to grow your business by becoming more in tune with the digital world.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to help\!
