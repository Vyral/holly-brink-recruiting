Today on “Hustle With Holly,” I’m joined by special guest Sandi Lynn from That Broker Girl to talk about some of the exciting things that happened at EXPCON 2020, eXp’s multi-day virtual event for networking and collaboration.

Though there were some technical issues with the live stream on eXp World where the event was hosted, they recorded over 17,000 attendees from 35 different countries. That’s over half of all eXp agents, which is amazing\! One highlight of the event was an appearance by Robert Herjavec of the famed “Shark Tank” TV show. If you missed it, you can still catch it on YouTube by **[clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5eYl-99kalLanjBI9iJZH2dzCuXsVduB){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** to watch a playlist of breakout sessions and conversations had at the convention.&nbsp;

**Watch the video above to hear our recap of the event and some of our key takeaways.** As always, if you have any questions about upcoming events or virtual seminars to help you improve your real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to have a conversation with you.
