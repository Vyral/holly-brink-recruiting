Do you wish clients would just pick up the phone and call you so that you didn’t have to go out and look for leads? One way to do this is to establish yourself as a market expert.

If you want to be a local market expert, here are some things to consider. First, **one of the most important things that you’ll do in any market is preview property on a daily basis.** So until you truly are a market expert, one of the best ways to become one is to get inside houses.

Try to take a look at all available open houses in your area–you can even bring a family member or a friend along to make things more fun. Make sure you tell the other agent that you’re previewing the property so that you can maybe piggyback on someone else's showing at a time that's convenient for them.

If a property is vacant, typically they don't care when you go, but you still want to reach out and make that appointment or follow the showing instructions on the MLS. Get out there, go to other agents, open houses, introduce yourself–you always want to identify yourself as an agent. This is one of the best ways to become an expert in your market.

From here, **it’s time to focus on the details.** Make sure you've eaten at every restaurant in your local community so you can speak from experience. What was your favorite dish? Did you like it? Is it mainly Mexican? Is it Chinese? You want to be able to speak from experience about the little things in your area.

One way to get in touch with local businesses is to film a video with them. You’ll get to understand what makes them work a little better, and they’ll be able to get the word out about how they serve the community. It’s a win-win\! You can even host a small event at some businesses to get to know your clients better.&nbsp;

Finally, learn how to answer common questions people moving have. Where is the nearest post office? Where are the schools? What are their ratings? Do you know the principal? Don't be afraid to have those conversations.&nbsp;

If you’re a local expert, clients will flock to you for advice and business. Don’t hesitate to call or email me with any questions. I am always willing to help\!&nbsp;
