Every time you reach out to someone, whether through a text, phone call, or email, you want to give more than you receive; you should be offering information that has real value. Here are some tips on how to go about doing that:&nbsp;

**1\. Provide information on their market.** Have homes in their neighborhood sold recently? What’s the estimated value of their home? Be personal, and make sure you’re able to provide them with something applicable to their situation.&nbsp;

**2\. Connect with vendors and provide a vendor list to your clients.** Reach out to one of your trusted vendors, and ask them if they’d be interested in doing an interview that will provide information to your clients. See if it’s possible to arrange a special offer for your clients through that vendor— maybe it’s half-off on a service they provide. Work together with that vendor to come up with a creative offer of some kind. That way, your clients are provided with value and the vendor generates business—a win-win.&nbsp;

**3\. Invest in tools or equipment clients may need, and offer to loan them out.** Air machines and pressure washers are examples of tools that the average homeowner only uses once in a blue moon. Having such equipment on standby and offering it to your clients is a great way to show that you truly do anticipate the needs of your clients. Moving trucks are another great resource you could offer.&nbsp;

**4\. Start hosting events.** There’s truly no limit to the kinds of events you could create, but sometimes you’ll be inspired by the success of someone else’s event and adapt it to fit your own business. For example, pie giveaways are a great way to win people over. You can hand deliver pies, or invite people to stop by your office for a quick pie pick-up. Will you offer 30 pies or 300 pies? Either way, you could partner with your lender so you can split costs and also invite twice as many people. Barbecues and movie nights are also awesome examples.&nbsp;

Hopefully, this list has left you inspired and in a productive, creative mode\! As always, if you need anything at all, or have some real estate-related questions that need to be answered, reach out to me via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you\!
