Are you trying to figure out how to get through all the looky-loos and find serious buyers? There are many ways to weed out noncommital buyers so you don't waste your time. Here are three tips for you:&nbsp;

**1\. Get potential buyers pre-qualified.** You want to make sure that they're talking to their bank or your preferred lender. Stop them and find out from a lender what they qualify for and when they can qualify to buy.&nbsp;

**2\. Schedule a buyer consultation.** You want to find out what they're looking for and show your value. Find out what they need and what they want. If a buyer is not willing to take the time to talk to you about what they're looking for so that you can best serve them, they might be in the market to just look instead of act.&nbsp;

**3\. Look out for buyers who seem to only make sign calls.** It’s a big red flag when someone says they've been working with a lot of agents and have made a lot of sign calls.&nbsp;
