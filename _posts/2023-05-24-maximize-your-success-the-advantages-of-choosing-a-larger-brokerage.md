When it comes to selecting a brokerage for your real estate career, the decision between a local regional brokerage and a nationwide or global brokerage can be a crucial one. Let’s discuss the advantages of joining a larger brokerage. They offer unique benefits that can significantly impact an agent's career:

**1\. Brokerage accessibility.** One of the key benefits of joining a larger brokerage is the unparalleled accessibility it offers. Unlike smaller local brokerages, where brokers may be difficult to reach due to their busy schedules, larger brokerages prioritize being available to their agents. At eXp Realty, for example, broker accessibility is a top priority. Agents can rely on brokers who are dedicated to answering their calls and providing guidance whenever needed. This accessibility ensures that agents receive the support they require to excel in their real estate careers.

**2\. Extensive education resources.** Education plays a vital role in the growth and success of real estate agents. While smaller brokerages may offer limited educational opportunities, larger nationwide or global brokerages provide a wealth of resources for agents to enhance their skills and knowledge. In addition to traditional sources such as YouTube, larger brokerages often offer comprehensive training programs. eXp Realty, for instance, boasts over 40 hours of live training sessions and an extensive resource library with thousands of hours of recorded training. This wealth of educational materials ensures that agents have access to on-demand training at any time, empowering them to stay ahead in the industry.

**3\. Emphasis on collaboration.** Collaboration is a crucial aspect of real estate success, and it can be challenging to find in smaller local brokerages where agents often see each other as direct competition. However, larger brokerages foster a collaborative environment that encourages agents to support and help one another. At eXp Realty, agents not only collaborate within their own teams but also with agents from other markets. This collaboration extends beyond sharing knowledge and expertise; it involves co-branding events, joint marketing efforts, and creating opportunities for mutual growth.

If you are an ambitious real estate professional looking to thrive in a dynamic and supportive ecosystem, a larger nationwide or global brokerage may be the ideal fit for you. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email.
