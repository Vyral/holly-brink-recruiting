Brad from Surprise, Arizona, recently reached out and asked us, “I have my real estate license; what do I do now?” Once you have passed your exams and received your license, there are three simple things you can do to get started:

**1\. Make a list of everyone you know and put them into your CRM.** Your brokerage probably provides one like Commissions, Inc., Liondesk, etc. The best CRM is the one that you know how to use. Some agents use notecards and others just use Outlook, so don’t let not having much money hold you back.&nbsp;

Once you have things set up, reach out to them on Facebook or LinkedIn to see if they or someone they know is interested in buying or selling a home. You'll also want to send out an email announcing that you have your license, which brokerage you’ve joined, and why. Send snail mail to those people who you have addresses for. Even if they’re not in the area, they might know someone who is and will pass your name along.&nbsp;

This is a great way to get your name out there and increase your referral business. Make sure that your contact information for your database is up to date. Give everyone on your contact list a call, confirm their email, see how long they’ve been in their home, find out whether or not they want market updates, and ask general questions about their real estate goals.

**2\. Get a copy of the listing packet and buyer packet that your brokerage wants you to use.** Read through these documents and highlight anything you don’t understand. Ask your broker, mentor, etc. about anything you have highlighted.

**3\. Reach out to other agents within your company who are busy.** Ask them if you can help in any way with setting up open houses, nurturing leads, and getting more referrals.

These are the three most cost-effective, smartest ways to get started in your real estate career. If you have any questions for me about what else you can do now to ensure future success in the real estate industry, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
