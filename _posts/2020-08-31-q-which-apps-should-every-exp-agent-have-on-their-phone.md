Welcome back to another episode of “Hustle With Holly.” Today I’ve got some great tips specifically for eXp Realty agents. I’ll go over all of the go-to apps that you need to have downloaded to make your life easier and your business more successful.&nbsp;

Here’s an outline of the video, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you most:

0:24- The eXp Realty platforms that you should have on your phone

2:34- Why you need to bookmark Okta.com

3:41- How IntroLend helps you stay in touch with your lenders

4:40- Why I fell in love with HomeKeeper and how it makes your clients’ lives easier

5:55- Why I strongly suggest all eXp agents opt-in to Ringcentral when they start

7:02- The strong potential of the ShowMeNow app

8:05- Wrapping things up

If you have any questions for me about eXp Realty, any of the apps that I mentioned in today’s video, or something else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’m here to be a resource for you, and I look forward to hearing from you\!
