You need to know what you're going to say when you talk to a seller. There's a plethora of questions. We all ask questions like, “Why do you think your home didn't sell? “, “How much do you want for your home? “ or “How soon do you want to be where you're going?” However, there's one question that you should be asking every seller that you talk to: **"What are your plans after the home sells?"**

If you start with this question, it should indirectly answer a couple of key questions about timing, motivation, and whether or not they'll be buyers too. Starting with this question can also help you engage in a conversation with the seller and build rapport. By getting them talking about their plans, you can establish a connection and show that you're genuinely interested in helping them find the best solution for their needs.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email.
