Today I’m sharing a Zoom call I had with Dan Chandler of Rice Insurance, which is one of the companies that have an agreement with the Iowa Real Estate Commission to provide all real estate licensees and brokers with errors and omissions insurance. If you’re like me, you know that we need to have this coverage, but you’re not really sure exactly what it covers or how to use it. I ask Dan a ton of questions to help us all get a better understanding of how this required coverage benefits us.&nbsp;
