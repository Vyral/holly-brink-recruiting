*Here’s my recent conversation with superstar agent John Ruckman.*

Today I’m sharing a Zoom call that I had recently with eXp Realty agent John Ruckman, a specialist in Broker Price Opinion (BPO) and Real Estate Owned (REO) properties. We talked about these two types of properties, how he got started working them, and much more.

**Here’s an outline of our conversation with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you most:**

0:45- What are short sales?

2:45- John discusses his journey in real estate, and how he got into BPOs and REOs

4:35- A secret you should know about BPOs

7:03- John’s 90-day action plan for agents who want to get into BPOs

10:33- A look at the different platforms John uses to find these types of properties

14:00- John talks about his platform, Mission2Mindset.com, which includes his free 90-day action plan among other free resources

If you have questions for me about what we discussed or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
