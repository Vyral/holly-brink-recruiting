As the broker of eXp Realty in Iowa, I’ve seen plenty of agents switch over from other brokerages. **If you’re considering switching brokerages, one important factor you’ll need to consider is timing.** It seems that some people worry too much about timing while others don’t worry enough about it.

The agents that seem to have the most success try to plan their timing a little bit, but they don’t stress too much about it. **I would say that giving yourself one to two weeks of lead time is ideal, and I think the best time of year to transfer is right around the holidays** when the market isn’t quite as busy. You can launch your announcement of joining a new brokerage at the beginning of the year, which could be great for you.

The agents that struggle with this transition are the ones who don’t prepare. You always want to make sure you talk to the broker in charge, plan a little bit, know what the paperwork looks like, figure out how your pending files are going to be processed, etc., beforehand.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about switching brokerages or the real estate business in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
