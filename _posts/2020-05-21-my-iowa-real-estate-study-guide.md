I’ve been hearing from a ton of new agents who have already been licensed in another state or passed their national exam, but are having trouble getting licensed in Iowa. So I created my own study guide if you’re in a similar position.

I ask the questions I think you should know in order to pass the Iowa portion of the exam. I went back through all my notes and while I don’t know exactly what’s on the exam, I do know the most important things you need to know.
