Are you a real estate agent who got into the business because you hated the 9-5 and being told what to do? Do you want to create your own perfect day schedule? If yes, then you are in the right place.

Successful real estate agents follow a schedule, but the great thing is that you can create what that perfect day schedule looks like for you. You can decide when you want to take your breaks and when you're going to do things. However, there are some things that you should consider, like time blocking, never deleting, just moving and prioritizing.

**Time blocking is essential to become more efficient.** If you're going to do late follow-up, you want to do that in a one- to two-hour block, and it doesn't even matter the increment of the block, but you want to do it in the block, do all of your lead follow-up. If you're going to batch-record videos, you want to block that in your schedule. If you're going to call all of your current clients that are under contract or actively listed, you want to do that in the same block of time.

Another important thing to remember is that **you can always move but never delete the priorities.** The first thing you should do is put the days in your calendar when your kids have no school, half days, and when you're going to take vacations. Then, build your business schedule around that.

Health and fitness are also important. So, you can set a plan to go to the gym or do some exercise at specific times. Always remember that you can move things around but cannot delete them.

It's essential to track your progress, and that's why you should plan your perfect day and try to stick to it. If you find yourself deviating from your schedule, write down what you're doing and why you're not following your plan. You can always go back and look at what took natural priority over something that you thought was a priority and what you may want to do differently in the following week.

As always, don’t hesitate to call or email me with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
