The eXp University Expand Mentor program was developed for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, every state has some sort of entity, usually a real estate commission, that oversees all of its brokers and wants to ensure that all new licensees are getting the one-on-one attention they need to succeed while staying compliant with the respective real estate laws. The Expand Mentor program helps with just that; when you come to eXp Realty, you’ll be partnered with somebody in your local area MLS (it may or may not be someone you already know) who will be donating their time to help you become better at the craft.&nbsp;

This program is a commitment that costs an extra 20% of your commission for the first three transactions of your real estate career. Of course, you’ll get immense value for this temporary 60-40 split, including **a one-on-one relationship with someone who’s been in the industry for quite some time and is producing at a high level.** Among countless other things, your eXp mentor will be able to explain your local board forms. Typically, the person who signs up to be a mentor has the heart of a teacher, and will be personally invested in your success.&nbsp;

This mentor will only be receiving 10% of your commission, so it’s not as if they’re making millions of dollars off of you; they’re doing this out of the goodness of their heart. There is a list of items that they’re supposed to go over with you, and you’ll receive this list when you enroll. Additionally, **there’s an online component, with 10 modules for you to complete that cover everything from business planning to time management.** You’ll be expected to meet weekly with your mentor and go over a weekly report card of sorts until you complete those first three transactions, after which you’ll be able to graduate from the program.&nbsp;

That said, you have to go to your mentor with any additional questions or what have you—they won’t be checking in on you or chasing you down. If they don’t hear from you outside of your regular meetings, they’ll assume you’re feeling confident and comfortable.&nbsp;

Also, **eXp created a fast-start series consisting of 14 classes that any new agent can join in on live or explore later in the eXp library;** this is a great supplement for those 10 Expand Mentor program modules.&nbsp;

Hopefully, this gives you a better understanding of eXp culture and how we prepare you for success. As always, reach out to me via phone or email if you have questions on this program or anything else related to standard eXp practice. I’m more than happy to help\!
